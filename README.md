# BinaryTree
Public Reference Implementation of a Binary Tree, as a Code Style Demonstration.
This code implements a binary tree in C# based on the Binary Tree documentation available at 
http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/110/BinaryTrees.html

The purpose of this demonstration is to provide an example of:

1) A useable Binary Tree Reference Implementation in C#
2) A showing of readable, educational code
3) Implementation of generic payloads within the Binary Tree class
4) A showing of comments within the code
5) A showing of unit testing of the code
6) Application of branching and merging in git with visual studio code

BinaryTree is a generic class and therefore does not contain a main method.

PrintingMethods.cs has a Main method which can be run with the command "dotnet run" to show console output verifying BinaryTree.cs functionality.

TestClass.cs contains Xunit tests which can be run with the command "dotnet test" to show console output verifying BinaryTree.cs functionality.

Expected results are included as comments in PrintingMethods.cs and TestClass.cs files as comments.
